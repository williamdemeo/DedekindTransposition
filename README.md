## Notes on a general Dedekind transposition principle

If L is a modular lattice, then for any two elements a and b in L,
the intervals [b, a V b] and [a ^ b, a] are isomorphic.

This repository contains some notes describing a more general version of
Dedekind's Transposition Principle that holds in all (not necessarily modular)
lattices of equivalence relations.
